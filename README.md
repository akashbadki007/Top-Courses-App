## Top-Courses-App

### Project Overview
The "Top-Courses-App" is a single-page web application developed using React JS and Tailwind CSS, designed to help users discover top courses across various categories. The application features categories such as Web Development, Business, Lifestyle, and Design. Users can view all courses or filter courses by specific categories. The application fetches course data from a RESTful API to dynamically display the information.

### Objectives
- **Course Discovery:** To provide users with a comprehensive list of top courses across various categories.
- **Category Filtering:** To allow users to filter courses by specific categories such as Web Development, Business, Lifestyle, and Design.
- **Dynamic Data Display:** To fetch and display course data dynamically from a RESTful API.

### Technologies Used
- **React JS:** For building a responsive and dynamic single-page application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application with a modern and clean design.
- **RESTful API:** For fetching course data from a remote server.
  - **API URL:** `https://codehelp-apis.vercel.app/api/get-top-courses`

### Key Features
- **Course Categories:** Includes categories such as Web Development, Business, Lifestyle, and Design.
- **Filter Functionality:** Users can click on a category to view courses specific to that category or click "All" to view all courses.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering:** Fetches and displays course data from a RESTful API.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application is accessible and visually appealing on various devices.

### Challenges Faced
- **API Integration:** Integrating the RESTful API to fetch and display dynamic course data.
- **Category Filtering:** Implementing efficient filtering mechanisms to display courses based on selected categories.
- **Design Consistency:** Ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design using Tailwind CSS.

### Conclusion
The "Top-Courses-App" project demonstrates my ability to develop a dynamic and user-friendly single-page web application using React JS and Tailwind CSS. By integrating a RESTful API, the application can fetch and display real-time course data, allowing users to discover and filter top courses across various categories. This project highlights my proficiency in React, Tailwind CSS, and API integration, along with a focus on creating an intuitive and responsive user interface.
